TODO    (GOOD TO END 1+2 BY FIRST HALF OF MAY)   

    1  Main Program functionalities:
      -   Login/rejestration to system Module - extra content for logged user -
      -   Normal user can register visit(By a "card from calendar" which can be show non avalible terms), check his prescriptions (maybe print as .pdf or directly to default printer ),
      -  Doctor account can write a prescriptions, change some medical data, time of visits, checks list of patients
      -   A doctor may be assigned to an office (for the period from-to). After the date is exceeded, the office is automatically released.
      -   Make a simple, transparent GUI
      -   The shown lists with the indicated data should be nicely displayed, with the possibility of sorting, scrolling
      -
  2 Database features
      - We need to implement basic operation on DB (Select, Insert, Delete ), implement a little more complicated things like triggers, procedures.
          It should be our showcase to DB project, so lets implement some diffrent, not obvious (but with logical use ) things. 
      - We should implement in our GUI some kind of list with patients, offices, stuff, which we can sort to be good to view. (extra "points" at DB project)
      - ALL FEATURES NEED TO BE WELL THOUGHT AND FUNCTIONAL 
      -
 3 Network programing elements : TODO sockets or REST API
      We can put server with DB, local clients may sending request by TCP to serwer for queries, client will wait for server massage and parse to nice gui interview.  
      
      We should start work at first half of april, after learn some more advanced thinks at PB/PR3 (good to know JDBC, JAVAFX)



NEED TO IMPLEMENT 
    JAVA:
        Classes for nonLoggedUser (login/register to system, register visit (should add necessary data ) ),
            loggedUser (checking his prescriptions, showing list of his active visits) , 
            Doctor (write prescription; list today patients; changing visits data; assigning office for some time; can receive sorted data from DB about patients or smth WE SHOULD THING ABOUT THAT  )
              Doctor Office ( list non avalible dates, TODO)
